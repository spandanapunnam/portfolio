  <h1>About Me</h1>
  
  <p>
    Hello! My name is <strong>Spandana</strong>. I am currently pursuing my
    Master of Computer Applications (MCA)  I have a strong
    interest in technology and enjoy learning how software and web applications
    are built.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am particularly interested in web development and enjoy working with
    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic backend concepts. I like building simple
    and clean projects that focus on usability and functionality.
  </p>

  <p>
    Along with technical skills, I am actively improving my communication
    skills and problem-solving abilities to prepare myself for interviews and
    professional environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    My goal is to start my career in the IT industry as an entry-level
    developer, where I can learn from real-world projects, grow my skills,
    and contribute meaningfully to a team.
  </p>
  <p>
  Outside of academics, I enjoy learning new things, watching movies,
  and continuously working on self-improvement.
